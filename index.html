             <h2>Big Dream</h2>
             <h3>Become World No 1 Developer</h3>
             <p>So as I drifted from job to job gaining valuable & diverse experience, I still managed to squeeze in a few web-design related projects into the mix. Whether it was a new website for the company I worked for, or building them an intranet,or updating their existing one,even volunteering to manage my website, I managed to keep the web design dream somewhat alive.</p>

             <p>Before we get into actual coding, let’s first take a look at some general information on what web development is: how websites work, the difference between front and back-end, and using a code editor.All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files that are stored on a computer called a server. This server is connected to the internet. You can then load that website through a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on your computer or your phone.</p>
